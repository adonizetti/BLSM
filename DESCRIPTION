Description: R package allowing the computation of a Bayesian latent space 
    model for complex networks, either weighted or unweighted.
    Given an observed input graph, the estimates for the latent coordinates 
    of the nodes are obtained through a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. 
    The overall likelihood of the graph depends on a fundamental probability 
    equation, which is defined so that ties are more likely to exist 
    between nodes whose latent space coordinates are close. 
    The package allows the user to inspect the MCMC simulation, 
    create insightful graphical representations or apply clustering techniques.

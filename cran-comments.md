## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.4
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.


## Resubmission

* Rephrased starting sentence in the description
* Added missing DOI in the description
* Added new examples and improved the existing ones. It's not possible for the main functions to give meaningful outputs if the simulations are too short, so I've introduced a couple of dontshow examples for testing purposes on a few iterations. I've also removed all the dontrun statements from examples which can be quickly executed.

Thanks, please do not start your description with "This package", package name or similar. Just start with "Computes..." or "Privides...".

Please add a DOI, arXiv or ISBN to your reference in your description text in the form
Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002) <doi:...>
Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002) <arXiv:...>
Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002, ISBN:...)
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:' and angle brackets for auto-linking.

Most of your examples are wrapped in \dontrun{} and hence not tested. Please unwrap the examples if that is feasible and if they can be executed in < 5 sec for each Rd file or create additionally small toy examples. Something like
\examples{
       examples for users and checks:
       executable in < 5 sec
       \dontshow{
              examples for checks:
              executable in < 5 sec together with the examples above
              not shown to users
       }
       donttest{
              further examples for users (not used for checks)
       }
}
would be desirable.

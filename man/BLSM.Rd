\title{Bayesian Latent Space Model}
\details{
R package allowing the computation of a Bayesian Latent Space Model for Complex Networks.

Given a network characterized by its adjacency \eqn{Y} and weights \eqn{W} matrices, the model assigns a binary random 
variable to each tie: e.g., \eqn{Y_ij} is related to the tie between nodes \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} and its value is 1
if the tie exists, 0 otherwise. 
 
The model assumes the independence of \eqn{Y_ij | x_i,x_j\alpha}, where \eqn{x_i} and \eqn{x_j} are the coordinates
of the nodes in the multidimensional latent space and \eqn{\alpha} is an additional parameter such that 
\eqn{P(Y_ij = 1) = \alpha - ||x_i -x_j||}.

The latent space coordinates are estimated by maximizing the overall likelihood induced by the above equation. 

The output of the model allows the user to inspect the MCMC simulation, create insightful graphical representation or 
apply further clustering techniques to better describe the latent space. 
See \link[BLSM]{estimate_latent_positions} or \link[BLSM]{plot_latent_positions} for further information.
